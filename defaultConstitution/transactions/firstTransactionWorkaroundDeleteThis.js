/**
 * FIXME
 * The first block in the blockchain is 0.
 * When creating a CSB, if only one transaction is committed (only one block written) then only the block 0
 * will be written and blocks/index will have the value 0
 * When loading again the CSB, the CSB's blockchain will replay transaction from pulse 0 until 0, currentPulse
 * remaining 0. When creating a new transaction, it will have pulse 0 again and the block 0 will be overwritten.
 *
 * This transaction's purpose is to always start the blockchain with at least one transaction so it will hopefully
 * write at least two blocks in the beginning
